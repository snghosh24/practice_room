0-1 knapsack:
=============

input:
suppose there are items: I1, I2, I3, I4, I5
 
there is a weight array w[]={2,4,2,5,1}
there is a value array  v[]={5,3,4,2,7}

and there is a W denotes the capacity of knapsack. 
suppose W=7

output: Max profit

Why DP is required to solve the problem
1. Choice will be given: either In(nth item) will be added or not
2. Optimal things will be asked:Max profit is asked as output 


Identifying the Recursive solution:
