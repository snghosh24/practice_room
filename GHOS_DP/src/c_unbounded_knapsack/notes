0-1 Knapsack:
=============
if(w[n - 1] <= W)
1. If we consider the element to pick, then it's processed and we will be moving to next element
	val[n - 1] + knapsack(w, val, W - w[n - 1], n - 1)
2. If we consider not to pick the element then also it's processed and we will be moving to next element
	knapsack(w, val, W, n - 1);
	
if(w[n-1]>W)
1. we consider not to pick the element then also it's processed and we will be moving to next element
	knapsack(w, val, W, n - 1);
	
Unbounded Knapsack:
===================
if(w[n - 1] <= W)
1. If we consider the element to pick, then it's not processed and we reconsider the next element again
	val[n - 1] + knapsack(w, val, W - w[n - 1], n)
2. If we consider not to pick the element then also it's processed and we will be moving to next element
	knapsack(w, val, W, n - 1);
	
if(w[n-1]>W)
1. we consider not to pick the element then also it's processed and we will be moving to next element
	knapsack(w, val, W, n - 1);
